  body: An unexpected sunny January afternoon made for a gorgeous wedding day for this happy couple. The wedding was completely DIY by Heather, the bride and founder of Adelphi Productions. Not a single detail was overlooked for the lucky twenty-eight guests. Wine Caves, Vineyards, and Oscar-worthy gift bags were only some of the elements of this stunning event.
